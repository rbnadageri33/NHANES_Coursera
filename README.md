# Confidence intervals case study using NHANES data

# Conclusion
In summary, although normality of the data can play a role in determining the coverage properties of a confidence interval, it is generally not a major factor unless the sample size is quite small (much smaller than 50), or if the data are strongly non-normal.  In most cases, other factors besides Gaussianity of the individual data values are more likely to give rise to sub-optimal coverage. Two such factors that can cause major problems with CI coverage probabilities are clustering or other forms of dependence in the data, and overt or hidden pre-testing or multiplicity in the analysis. Clustering will be discussed extensively in Course 3.  We will discuss multiplicity in Week 3 of this course.
